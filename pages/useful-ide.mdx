# Using the IDE to the fullest

This page gives useful bits of information, to speed up and ease the workflow of developers. Incorporate them into yours, to your liking.

<Callout type="info">It may take some time to learn and get used to the shortcuts and other options. Use this page as a reference to get used to them.</Callout>

## Traversing projects

### Manually

IntelliJ has many different ways of traversing projects. If you have generated Sources using the... 

```
./gradleW genSources
```

...command in the terminal
or used the `Tasks > fabric > genSources` Gradle Task in the Gradle Window, you can manually go trough the source files of Minecraft in the
Project Window's External Libraries. 

![Gradle Task](/useful-ide/traversing_01.png)

<Subtitle>Generate Sources using the Gradle Task</Subtitle>

The Minecraft Source code can be found if you look for `net.minecraft`, but also other sources of projects, which are imported using the `build.gradle` file
are located in there. This method is often used when browsing for assets, tags and other files.

<Subtitle>To search in the Project Window, just focus it and start typing</Subtitle>

### Search

Pressing `Shift` twice opens up a Search window. In there you can search for your project's files and classes. When Activating the checkbox `include non-project items`
or by pressing `Shift` two times again, the search will look not only in your own project, but also in other's, such as the External Libraries.

## Traversing code

### Jump to Definition / Usage

If you need to check out either the definition or the usage of variables, methods, classes, and other things, you can press `CTRL + Left Click`
or use `Middle Mouse Button` (pressing Mouse wheel) on their name. This way you can avoid long scrolling sessions or a manual
search for a definition which is located in another file.

### Bookmarks



## Analyzing classes

### Structure of a class

By opening the `Structure` window (`Alt + 7`) you will get an overview of your currently active class. You can see which Classes and Enums
are located in that file, which methods have been implemented and which fields / variables are declared.

Sometimes it can be helpful,
to activate the `Inherited` option at the top as well, when looking for potential methods to `@Override`.

![Structure window](/useful-ide/analyzing_01.png)

### Type Hierarchy of a class

By placing the cursor on a class name and pressing `CTRL + H` you can open a new Type Hierarchy window, which shows all parent and child classes.

![Type Hierarchy window](/useful-ide/analyzing_02.png)

## Code utility

### Code completion 

Code completion should be activated by default. You will automatically get the recommendations while writing your code. If you closed it by
accident or just moved your cursor to a new place, you can use `CTRL + Space` to open them up again.

For example, when using Lambdas, you can write them quickly using this method.

![Lambda with many parameters](/useful-ide/util_01.png)

### Displaying parameters

Displaying parameters should be activated by default. You will automatically get the types and names of the parameters while writing your code.
If you closed them by accident or just moved your cursor to a new place, you can use `CTRL + P` to open them up again.

Methods and classes can have multiple implementations with different parameters (also known as Overloading). This way you can decide on which
implementation you want to use, while writing method the call.

## Comments

### Prepare Shortcuts

Good code should be easily readable and [self-documenting](https://bytedev.medium.com/code-comment-anti-patterns-and-why-the-comment-you-just-wrote-is-probably-not-needed-919a92cf6758). Picking expressive names for variables, classes and methods can help a lot, but sometimes
comments are neccessary to leave notes and <b>temporarily</b> disable code for testing.

To comment out code faster, open IntelliJ's Settings, look for the `Comment with Line Comment`
and the `Comment with Block Comment` entries, and set their Keybinds to your preferences.

![Keymap settings](/useful-ide/comments_01.png)

<Subtitle>Open IntelliJ Settings (`File > Setings > Keymap`)</Subtitle>

Now you can highlight the neccessary code and use the shortcuts, to comment the section out.

```java
// private static final int PROTECTION_BOOTS = 2;
private static final int PROTECTION_LEGGINGS = 5;
// private static final int PROTECTION_CHESTPLATE = 6;
private static final int PROTECTION_HELMET = 1;
```

```java
/*
ModItems.initialize();
ModSounds.initializeSounds();
ModParticles.initialize();
*/

private static int secondsToTicks(float seconds) {
    return (int) (seconds * 20 /*+ 69*/);
}
```

<Subtitle>Examples of Line and Block comments</Subtitle>

### Region comments

In IntelliJ, right next to the line numbers, you can have small [+] and [-] icons. Those can be used to temporarily collapse methods, if-statements, classes and many other things
if you are not actively working on them. To create a custom block which can be collapsed, use the `region` and `endregion` comments.

```java
// region collapse block name
    ModBlocks.initialize();
    ModBlockEntities.registerBlockEntityTypes();
    ModItems.initialize();
    ModSounds.initializeSounds();
    ModParticles.initialize();
// endregion

```

If you notice that you are using too many of them, consider refactoring your code to make it more readable!</Callout>

### TODO and FIXME notes

When working on code it can come in handy to leave notes, on what still needs to be taken care of. Sometimes you may also spot
a potential issue in the code but you don't want to stop focusing on the current problem. In this case use the
`TODO` or `FIXME` comments.

![TODO and FIXME comments](/useful-ide/comments_03.png)

IntelliJ will keep track of them in the `TODO` window and may notify you, if you commit code,
which uses those type of comments.

### Javadocs

A great way of documenting your code is the usage of JavaDoc. JavaDocs not only provide useful infomration for implementation of methods and classes, but are also
deeply integrated into IntelliJ.

When hovering over method or class names, which have JavaDoc comments added to them, they will display this information in their information window.

![JavaDoc](/useful-ide/comments_06.png)

<Subtitle>Example JavaDocs information</Subtitle>

To get started, simply write `/**` above the method or class definition and press enter. IntelliJ will automatically generate lines for the return value
and the parameters but you can change them however you want. There are many custom functionalities available and you can also use HTML if needed.

Minecraft's `ScreenHandler` class has some examples. To toggle the render view, use the pen button near the line numbers.
